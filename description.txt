Shortswords may be the most ignored weapons in the game. Usually, a player immediately goes for a Wooden Sword or a Cactus Sword and ignores the shortswords afterwards. This mod aims to make them more useful by upgrading the vanilla shortswords and adding a number of new ones. The mod also adds "unconventional" shortswords which work like spears, so that they can be used in any direction. Some of them even shoot projectiles!
